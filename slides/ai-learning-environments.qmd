:::{.callout-note}
- **BFH’s Stance**: Technologies that support the learning process and are relevant in practice should be integrated into teaching.
- **Use of AI in Teaching**: The majority of students will use AI tools. Students should learn to use technologies competently and to critically question them.

- Access to GPT-4o, excelling in text interpretation, coding, and mathematics
- Data analytics, web browsing, and document summarization
- Build GPTs, custom versions of ChatGPT, and share them within university workspaces
- Significantly higher message limits than the free version of ChatGPT
- Improved language capabilities across quality and speed, with over 50 languages supported
- Robust security, data privacy, and administrative controls
- Conversations and data are not used to train OpenAI models

## GPTs

![](../assets/images/gpt-store.png){width=66%}


## Hands-on practice: GPTs

1) Try out custom GPTs from various categories in the [GPT store](https://chatgpt.com/gpts).
2) Discuss with your neighbour
    a) Did you discover any useful GPTs?
    b) What are the benefits and limitations of using GPTs in the classroom?


## Extended cognition

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

- According to @clarkExtendedMind1998, cognitive processes may extend to external objects.
- @krakauerWillHarmUs2016 distinguishes between **complementary** and **competitive** cognitive artifacts.
  - Complementary: numbers, abacus
  - Competetive: calculator, GPS
  
- What kind of artefact will AI turn out to be?

## Writing tasks in the AI era

- Writing is a core skill: critical thinking, persuasion, argumentation, understanding.
- Text creation is secondary in learning: focus is on underlying skills.
- Learning objectives: Benefits of writing tasks should be clearly and convincingly conveyed.
- Students should be equipped for effective (controlled) use of AI. 

## AI can do my homework

- We can think of this as cheating.
- More useful: cheating means _bypassing useful cognition_ and therefore missing out on learning.
- Cheating an ethics problem. 
- Bypassing cognition is a learning problem.
- Not a new problem: books, encyclopedias, calculators, spell checkers, etc.
<!-- - Before AI tasks and exercises provoked students to do useful cognition that led to learning.
- Now a machine can do some of that work for them. -->

## Controlled use of LLMs

| Task Category           | Specific Tasks                                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Editing tasks           | Create/improve different versions of sections.  |
| Transitions             | Write and compare transitions.                  |
| Improve drafts          | Critique and refine drafts.                     |
| Writing styles          | Rewrite sections for different audiences.       |
| Controversial statements| Identify controversial points and strengthen arguments. |
| Research journal        | Keep a diary and use LLM for reflection.        |

# Learning Environments

## Understanding the value of effort
- Cheating can be a symptom that learners do not understand or value the importance of their own work. 
- Just like in sport: if we take shortcuts during training, we won’t get fit. 
- Understanding the purpose is important to endure discomfort. 
- Learners need to understand what they are supposed to learn, why it is valuable, and why effort and discomfort are necessary.

## Learning Environments that promote cheating {.smaller}

| Factors                   | Descriptions                                                                |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High pressure             | High stakes increase cheating. Fear of failure reinforces this.             |
| Lack of intrinsic motivation | Engagement and relevance are important. Lacking these makes cheating more attractive. |
| Perceived injustice       | Unfair grading leads to cheating.                                           |
| Low fear of getting caught| Low risk encourages cheating.                                               |
| Peer influence            | Widespread cheating among peers pressures students to join in.              |
| Low self-efficacy         | Doubts about one’s own abilities increase cheating as the seemingly only option. |


## Strategies to Reduce Cheating
| Strategies                 | Descriptions                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foster intrinsic motivation| Spark genuine interest. Provide choices and practical applications.           |
| Mastery learning           | Clear learning objectives. Focus on mastery of content. Include constructive and corrective feedback in formative assessments. |
| Reduce pressure            | Diversify assessment methods. Use portfolios and low-stress tests to reduce anxiety. |
| Strengthen self-efficacy   | Provide constructive feedback and promote peer learning (peer tutoring, peer review). |
| Create a culture of integrity | Open discussion about academic integrity. Set clear guidelines and promote community ethics. |

## How to cite ChatGPT

E.g. [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt) Style: Cite as software (not as personal communication).

## Documentating AI use
- Specifying prompts works well for inexperienced users, but inadequately reflects complex processes.
- Experienced users work with dialogues and several tools, not monolithic prompts in ChatGPT.
- Working with copilot (code): no traceable prompt input.
- **Instead**: Document the process, including the tools used and the steps taken.
  + Include used tools and steps in appendix, with optional graphical representation. 
  + Serves both evaluation and self-reflection.

- Is documentation meaningful in the long term, once the use of AI-based tools has become commonplace?

## Detecting AI use

-  Can be detected by the use of specific vocabulary and phrases: "delve", "vibrant", "embark", "it's important to note", " based on the data provided”.
-  Detection tools are not very useful, and can be easily circumvented.

- According to @fleckensteinTeachersSpotAI2024a
  + Generative AI can write papers that are undetectable.
  + Teachers overestimate their detection abilities.
