This document outlines the structure and activities for "The Power of Prompts" workshop, designed to help educators understand and utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively.

# Workshop Overview

The workshop is divided into several blocks, each focusing on different aspects of LLM usage and prompt engineering. Here's a brief overview of the structure:

1. Opening Block (15 min)
2. Foundation Block (45 min)
3. Break (15 min)
4. Intermediate Block (45 min)
5. Implementation Block (45 min)
6. Closing Block (15 min)

Let's dive into each block in more detail.

# Opening Block (15 min)

## Setup

:::{.callout-tip}
- Verify technical requirements
- Ensure LLM platform access
- Set up document sharing
:::

## Opening Activity: LLM Prediction Challenge

:::{.callout-note}
Before the main slides, engage participants with:

1. Display 3 surprising LLM outputs
2. Group discussion: What prompts created these?
3. Collect hypotheses
4. Reveal actual prompts
